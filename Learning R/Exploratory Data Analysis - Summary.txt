1: Principles of Analytic Graphs
--------------------------
basic principles of presenting data effectively
Edward Tufte's great 2006 book, Beautiful Evidence
Graphs give us a visual form of data, and the first principle of analytic graphs is to show some comparison.
So the first principle was to show a comparison. The second principle is to show causality or
| a mechanism of how your theory of the data works. This explanation or systematic structure
| shows your causal framework for thinking about the question you're trying to answer.

third principle: Multivariate data!
What is multivariate data you might ask? In technical (scientific) literature this term means
| more than 2 variables. Two-variable plots are what you saw in high school algebra.  Rememb

The fourth principle of analytic graphing involves integrating evidence. This means not
| limiting yourself to one form of expression. You can use words, numbers, images as well as
| diagrams. Graphics should make use of many modes of data presentation. Remember, "Don't let
| the tool drive the analysis!"

The fifth principle of graphing involves describing and documenting the evidence with sources
| and appropriate labels and scales. Credibility is important so the data graphics should tell
| a complete story. Also, using R, you want to preserve any code you use to generate your data
| and graphics so that the research can be replicated if necessary. This allows for easy
| verification or finding bugs in your analysis.

| The sixth and final principle of analytic graphing is maybe the most important. Content is
| king! If you don't have something interesting to report, your graphs won't save you.
| Analytical presentations ultimately stand or fall depending on the quality, relevance, and
| integrity of their content.
